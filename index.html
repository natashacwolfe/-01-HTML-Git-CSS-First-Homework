                    Hi there!<br>

                    I’m Natasha
                    I grew up in Alaska. Moved to the Seattle several years ago.
                    I am equally inspired by playing in nature and playing in the city.<br><br>
                    
                    I recently put away my scissors and pulled out a laptop. It’s always scary starting over.
                    But here I am, starting over. I'm looking forward to learning how to create
                    aesthetically pleasing things in a different way.
                    I am excited to be on unsteady ground learning, creating, and problem solving. <br><br>

                    Outside of work, you can find me hiking, practicing yoga, cooking, or at happy hour. 
                    My favorite cup of coffee is sipped at leisure and not rushed on the way to work. 
                    Spring is my favorite time of year, but I have love for winter. With out it, we would 
                    never get to slow down and recover from the long days of summer. Plus the smell of the 
                    air just before it snows is incredible and I love the quiet the snow brings.<br><br>
