First Portfolio 

This project was my first homework assignment. It helped me understand basic CSS and start blowing my mind with some more advanced CSS. I also was able to learn more about HTML structure and indentation. This site looks simple, but was a real first challenge and it felt great to complete it. This project took me 20+ hours to complete, I am mostly excited to look back at this project and see how quickly I can complete it in a few months!
